## 🚀 Running the Full System

Launch everything from a single command:

~~~bash
ros2 launch antobot_ant_description full_system.launch.py \
  world:=$HOME/.gazebo/worlds/agriculture.world
~~~

This will:
- Launch Gazebo with the selected world  
- Spawn the robot  
- Start the camera MJPEG stream  
- Launch the joystick MQTT controller

## 🎮 Joystick Control & MJPEG Camera via Mobile App

You can control the robot and view the camera stream using the mobile app located at:

AntoSim/App/lib/main.dart


To run the app:

~~~bash
cd AntoSim/App
flutter pub get
flutter run
~~~

## 📷 Viewing MJPEG Stream from Robot

Open in your browser:

http://localhost:5000/video

Or, select the camera icon on the mobile app wehn connected to the same network as the device


- Moves forward or stays still → front camera  
- Moves backward → rear camera

## 🧪 Debugging Tips

- No robot movement? Check `/cmd_vel` topic and MQTT  
- No image? Make sure Gazebo + robot is publishing `/front_camera/image_raw`  
- MQTT not connecting? Restart the mobile app first then Mosquitto if issues persist:
  ~~~bash
  sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
